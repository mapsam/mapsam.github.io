Let me start off with how I cannot take creative credit for this map whatsoever. I did some contract with Axis Maps, a stellar map design firm, who were preparing to release a new series of their typographic maps. I was excitedly chosen to create the Seattle version. The streets and research was completed by myself, while the [final](http://store.axismaps.com/product/seattle) product was formed by Axis. The final maps were released in Summer 2012.
