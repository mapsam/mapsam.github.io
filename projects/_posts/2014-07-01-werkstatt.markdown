This is a set of web tools that I've been developing to help with quick web needs. They've been made before, but not by me. The current toolset is comprised of [Akkordian](https://github.com/svmatthews/akkordian) (a web image accordian music player), [Galerie](https://github.com/svmatthews/galerie) (an image slider/gallery), and [Kino](https://github.com/svmatthews/kino) (a youtube embed player - still in progress). Each of these has been my opportunity to develop quick javascript libraries for myself to use, but more to learn about modular javascript libraries. I've enjoyed writing reusable, small-scale API's with them and have learned quite a bit about scope-oriented javascript. *Work In Progress*
