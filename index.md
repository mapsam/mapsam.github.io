### Hey, I'm Sam.

I'm a software engineer and geographer. I'm currently working at [Read AI](https://read.ai) in Seattle, WA on the backend team. I have over 10 years of experience designing and maintaining HTTP infrastructure, high performance Node.js APIs, and Python data pipelines. I focus on building tools to help teammates be more productive, simplify complex workflows, and bring a keen eye toward debugging, service observability, and fostering friendly teams.

I previously built tools to make fast and beautiful maps at [Mapbox](https://mapbox.com), improved health care delivery as a Fellow at [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org), and built websites at [Created Media Alliance](https://creativemediaalliance.com). I'm a former Editor for the [Atlas of Design](http://atlasofdesign.org) and proud member of [CUGOS](http://cugos.org). You can find most of my work on **[Github](http://github.com/mapsam)**.
