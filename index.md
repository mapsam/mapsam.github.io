### Howdy, I'm **Sam**.

Here you can find my [posts](/posts), [projects](/projects), and [resume](/resume).

I'm a software engineer, geographer, and friendly open source software contributor. I work at [Mapbox](https://mapbox.com) building tools to make fast and beautiful maps. I've been working on HTTP infrastructure, build systems, NodeJS libraries and servers, and python data processing pipelines for 8+ years.

Previously I was a [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org) Fellow working on [health care delivery](https://mapsam.com/rva/) in Richmond, VA. I'm a former Editor for the [Atlas of Design](http://atlasofdesign.org) and proud member of [CUGOS](http://cugos.org) where we build cool map projects like [Dropchop](https://github.com/cugos/dropchop).

You can find most of my work on **[Github](http://github.com/mapsam)**.
