### Why is it named _Bash_?

Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU operating system. The name is an acronym for the _Bourne-Again SHell_, a pun on Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct ancestor of the current Unix shell sh, which appeared in the Seventh Edition Bell Labs Research version of Unix.

### Why is it named _Node_?

Originally, Dahl called his project web.js. It was merely a webserver, an alternative to Apache and other "blocking" servers. But the project soon grew beyond his initial webserver library, expanding into a framework that could be used to build, well, almost anything. So he rechristened it node.js.

### Why is it named _Python_?

When he began implementing Python, Guido van Rossum was also reading the published scripts from “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”, a BBC comedy series from the 1970s. Van Rossum thought he needed a name that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious, so he decided to call the language Python.

### Why is it named _C++_?

C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup of Bell Labs in 1979. C++ was originally called ‘C with classes,’ and was built as an extension of the C language. Its name reflects its origins; C++ literally means ‘increment C by 1.’

It was renamed C++ in 1983, but retains a strong link to C, and will compile most C programs. Compared to C, C++ added object-oriented features to C such as classes, abstraction, and inheritance. [[source]](https://medium.com/sololearn/reasons-to-love-c-11c7c2f23d88)

### Why is it named _C_?

C  is  a  general purpose  computer  programming  language  developed  in  1972  by Dennis  Ritchie  at  the  Bell  Telephone  Laboratories  for  use  with  the  Unix  operating system.  It was named ‘C’ because many of its features were derived from an earlier language called ‘B’.

### Why is it named _B_?

B was derived from BCPL, and its name may possibly be a contraction of BCPL. Thompson's coworker Dennis Ritchie speculated that the name might be based on Bon, an earlier, but unrelated, programming language that Thompson designed for use on Multics.

### Why is it named _PostgreSQL_?

It was originally named POSTGRES, referring to its origins as a successor to the Ingres database developed at the University of California, Berkeley. (Post Ingres) [[source]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingres_(database)#Early_history)

### Why is it named a _dashboard_?

Originally applied to a barrier of wood or leather fixed at the front of a horse-drawn carriage or sleigh to protect the driver from mud or other debris "dashed up".

As car design evolved to position the motor in front of the driver, the dashboard became a panel that protected vehicle occupants from the heat and oil of the engine. With gradually increasing mechanical complexity, this panel formed a convenient location for the placement of gauges and minor controls. [[source]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard#Etymology)

### Why is it named _boto3_?

It was named after the fresh water dolphin native to the Amazon river. I wanted something short, unusual, and with at least some kind of connection to Amazon. Boto seemed to fit the bill 8^). [[source]](https://github.com/boto/boto3/issues/1023)
