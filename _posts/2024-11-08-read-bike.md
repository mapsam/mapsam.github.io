After nearly [9 years at Mapbox](http://localhost:4000/posts/mapbox), I decided to step away from my role as technical lead on the Maps API team to seek out a new challenge. I'm excited to join [Read AI](https://read.ai) as a senior engineer on the backend team!

While changing jobs is a sizeable life change on its own, one of the biggest changes is that I'm heading into an office three days a week. I've been remote since joining Mapbox, which has been an absolute privilege. It has has allowed me to be productive with my time on my terms, grant additional time to woodworking and DIY projects, and helped me build a more positive relationship with my career.

To be clear, remote work is not appealing because of the distance from co-workers. Historically I've never felt that far from my teams; we even had a WeWork office and co-working spaces here in Seattle for a few years. However, I began feeling more isolated as the team grew and hiring focused on other regions in North America and offices in Europe. Travel became less frequent and ultimately I was ready for more regular human interaction.

So, here I am three weeks into my new role, biking into the office when I can. Please enjoy some shots from my new commute, which I'm sure I'll be complaining about in no time ðŸ˜‰
