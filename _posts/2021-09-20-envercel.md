title: "Environments with Next.js and Vercel"
---

I learned about Vercel + Next.js when building Beepboop, a small journal app. This was a small foray into building apps with React's latest "hook" architecture. Deploying react apps was relatively new to me, as a backend engineer. I found Next.js and Vercel to fit pretty seamlessly into my preferred workflow:

1. make changes locally
1. view changes locally with local database
1. view changes locally with remote staging database
1. push changes to git branch
1. view changes on staging
1. merge changes into main branch
1. view changes on production

Vercel made this possible! I created **[envercel](https://github.com/mapsam/envercel)** to test my env configuration needs. It's a small application built with Next.js and deployed with Vercel to multiple environments: preview and production.

The app sorts and logs `process.env` so I could view what was available to the application at build and runtime. Vercel does a nice job at [documenting](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) their site-specific environment parameters as well. I created an environment variable `ENVERCEL` for both production and preview environments.

You can view the deployed site at [https://envercel.vercel.app/](https://envercel.vercel.app/) or the preview site at [https://envercel-preview.vercel.app/](https://envercel-preview.vercel.app/). The preview domain listens to any commits to the `preview` branch in GitHub. The production URL is deployed to any time a commit lands in the `main` (primary) branch in GitHub.
