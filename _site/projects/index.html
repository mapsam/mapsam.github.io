        <p>I was presented the awesome opportunity to help out with the <a href="https://2014.foss4g.org">2014 FOSS4G website</a> for the conference in Portland, OR. The project was completed over the course of many months with additions happening weekly.</p>

<p>The site took care of all presentation and workshop submissions, grant requests, and map gallery submissions.</p>

        <h2>Seattle Children's - SMAHRT Website</h2>
        <p>The SMAHRTeam, Social Media and Adolescent Health Research Team, asked to have a <a href="http://www.smahrtresearch.com/">website</a> put together that was made for doctors and parents alike. Designing a site for two audiences is a difficult task. The site focuses on simple navigation to information but also exploration of the information. Its design is professional and enjoyable. SMAHRT are great clients and I am still making updates to this website as they produce more publications and give more presentations.</p>

<p>Another project with SMAHRT was putting together a <a href="http://smahrtresearch.com/map/">map showcasing their presentations</a> at different conferences around the world. The result allows the user to sort and explore the different presentations by date, type, and location. <em>(built with leaflet)</em></p>

        <h2>There are several mountains</h2>
        <p>This is a quick project of mine to experiment with different typefaces and see how a variety of styles can work together towards a common theme. The quote is a simple translation I ran into during work. There is a tendency to choose one or two typefaces in projects in order to keep things straightforward for the viewer. This isn’t a bad philosophy to design by. Having too many different styles can make a graphic too complex and overwhelming to the eyes. See the <a href="http://giscollective.org/typeface-experiment/">full post</a>.</p>

        <p>I wanted to learn more about the Seattle when I moved into the city. I grabbed data from the USGS and showd anything below sea level as blue (duh) and anything above in an increasingly opaque greyscale. The city boundaries are on top and blend with the landscape. Puget Sound is a fascinating place!</p>

        <p>When I moved to Seattle I was able to make the move more of a vacation.

With little more than that request and locations, the map was concieved in-house and was more a project of data visualization than a map. Eventually the map was used in their annual print report.</p>

The streets and research was completed by myself, while the <a href="http://store.axismaps.com/product/seattle">final</a> product was formed by Axis. The final maps were released in Summer 2012.</p>

        <p>The Pope Farm Park needed some new trail maps (different orientations depending on where you enter the park).
