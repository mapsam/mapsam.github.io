        <h2>Werkstatt Web Tools</h2>
        <p>This is a set of web tools that I’ve been developing to help with quick web needs. They’ve been made before, but not by me. The current toolset is comprised of <a href="https://github.com/svmatthews/akkordian">Akkordian</a> (a web image accordian music player), <a href="https://github.com/svmatthews/galerie">Galerie</a> (an image slider/gallery), and <a href="https://github.com/svmatthews/kino">Kino</a> (a youtube embed player - still in progress). Each of these has been my opportunity to develop quick javascript libraries for myself to use, but more to learn about modular javascript libraries. I’ve enjoyed writing reusable, small-scale API’s with them and have learned quite a bit about scope-oriented javascript. <em>Work In Progress</em></p>

        <p>This is a project inspired by some client projects at work that was worth of further development since we use Instagram on website quite regularly. I consider it my first, full-scale javascript library that I’ve been versioning and building an API for. <a href="https://github.com/cmaseattle/instagram-grid">The library</a> is simply made to grab a set of Instagram images and build a responsive grid.

        <p>The SMAHRTeam, Social Media and Adolescent Health Research Team, asked to have a <a href="http://www.smahrtresearch.com/">website</a> put together that was made for doctors and parents alike. Designing a site for two audiences is a difficult task. The site focuses on simple navigation to information but also exploration of the information. Its design is professional and enjoyable. SMAHRT are great clients and I am still making updates to this website as they produce more publications and give more presentations.</p>

<p>Another project with SMAHRT was putting together a <a href="http://smahrtresearch.com/map/">map showcasing their presentations</a> at different conferences around the world. The result allows the user to sort and explore the different presentations by date, type, and location. <em>(built with leaflet)</em></p>

        <h2>There are several mountains</h2>
        <p>This is a quick project of mine to experiment with different typefaces and see how a variety of styles can work together towards a common theme. The quote is a simple translation I ran into during work. There is a tendency to choose one or two typefaces in projects in order to keep things straightforward for the viewer. This isn’t a bad philosophy to design by. Having too many different styles can make a graphic too complex and overwhelming to the eyes. See the <a href="http://giscollective.org/typeface-experiment/">full post</a>.</p>
